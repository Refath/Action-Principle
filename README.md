## Simulations

### Reflection in Equal Angles
1. Enable students to verify or derive $\theta_i = \theta_r$
2. Give students an insight into the optimization proof that results in Reflection
3. Clarify misconceptions (i.e., equal angles means incident ray hits metal equidistant from both points)

### Refraction by Snell's Law
1. Help students verify or derive $n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2$
2. Give students an insight into the optimization proof that results in Refraction
3. Clarify student questions (i.e., Why don't straight paths minimize time? What about paths that minimize the distance taken in water?)

### The Brachistochrone Problem
1. Give students an insight into the tug-of-war between the two parameters of path length and acceleration that determine the path of least time. 
2. Demonstrate how the principle of least action analytically determines the path of least time in the Brachistochrone problem. 
3. Aid students in drawing the analogy between the Brachistochrone problem and the behavior of light. In fact, Johann Bernoulli's solution to the problem was to imagine the brachistochrone as a path of light traveling through an optically homogenous medium. 

You will find 3 Jupyter Notebooks, each containing step-by-step instructions explaining how to use each of the three simulations of the LAP in Optics.
